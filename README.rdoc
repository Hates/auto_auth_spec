= auto_auth_spec

Simple gem that allows you to automatically spec your controllers authentication checks.

*NOTE:* This is a totally dumb speccer. It assumes all of your controllers actions require authentication and doesn't check for before_filter exceptions.

= Usage

In your Controller spec simply:

  require AuthAuthSpec
