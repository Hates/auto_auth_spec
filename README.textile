h1. auto_auth_spec

Simple gem that allows you to automatically spec your controllers authentication checks.

*NOTE:* This is a totally dumb speccer. It assumes all of your controllers actions require authentication and doesn't check for before_filter exceptions.

h1. Usage

In your Controller spec simply:

<pre>
require AuthAuthSpec
</pre>
